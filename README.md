# Unet_3d:Implemet on Tensorflow1.0-GPU
# Unet3d structure is in model create_conv_net function,layer is based operation.
# My Machine is GTX1080,when train it,the batchsize is one,too many batchsize lead to memory out.If you want sovel the bottleneck,you can # change GTX1080 to GTX1080Ti,or take mutilGPU for training
